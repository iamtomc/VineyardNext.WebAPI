# Contributing Guidelines
Please refer to these guidelines as you engage with this project.

## New Feature Requests
New feature requests are welcome! A diverse user base will identify more use-cases for this application. Your efforts are appreciated. To request a new feature, go to the Issues Tab. Click the "New Issue" button. Choose the Feature Request option. Complete the form as best as you can. If possible, give me the steps you took to identify the issue and how you use the application.

## Bug(!) Reports
No one likes bugs. However, we really dislike not knowing about bugs in our code. If you find a bug, please report the bug using the Issues tab. Click "New Issue." Click "Get Started" on the Bug Report section. Please provide me with good steps to reproduce your bug. How can I repeat the same behavior? Please explain what you expected the application to do? For example, "Expected behavior: Application to return full list of all groups from the /api/v1/groups endpoint. Observed behavior: Application returned a list of all addresses when making a call to the /api/v1/groups endpoint."

Bonus points if you have a working solution! Fork my repository. Work your coding magic. Submit a Pull Request! I'll add you to the Hall of Fame for your contributions.

## Community Responsibilities
I have created an open-source project to help others. The purpose of my project is to specifically use my talents and skills to help my church improve their ability to reach more people. This is a common problem for multiple organziations, some religious, some secular. I am interested in helping people organize and administer their groups. If you would like to contribute to this project, your work will be welcomed.

Be patient. I'm just one person working on this in my spare time, around personal obligations and a full-time developer career.

## Community Expectations
Treat each other with kindness and love. If that's not possible for you, I'll ask you not to contribute to this group. I don't think a 400 word policy will explain it any more plainly than that. If you think you're meeting the bare minimum to satisfy the expectations, maybe add another 25% to your efforts. Seriously, who has ever complained, "They were too nice to me? They loved me too much? They were overly kind?"
