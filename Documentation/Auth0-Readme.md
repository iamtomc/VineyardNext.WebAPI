## Disclaimer

I built this site using the Auth0 ready-made template for JWT authorization for a .NET Core (2.1) Web API. Some of the basic setup is their code. Some is mine. Where possible, I've credited Auth0 with authorship. Everything that follows is from the Auth0 Team.

This project is not affiliated with Auth0 in any way. They have awesome products. I'm a fan. My sole affiliation is being a customer/client/user.
